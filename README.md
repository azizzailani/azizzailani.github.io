# Portfolio (Minimal Static Version)

Single-page profile for Abdul Aziz Zailani. Built as a lightweight alternative to the previous
Jekyll site—no build step required, just static files.

## Structure

- `index.html` – main page with sections for About, Experience, Skills, and Contact.
- `styles.css` – minimal styling with a dark theme and responsive layout.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/azizzailani/azizzailani.github.io.git
cd azizzailani.github.io
# open index.html in your browser of choice
```

All assets are static; no server or tooling is needed.

## Customising

- Update the copy inside each section of `index.html`.
- Add or remove skills by editing the grid in the Skills section.
- Adjust colours or spacing in `styles.css`.
