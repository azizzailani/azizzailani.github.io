I'm Abdul Aziz Zailani, a DevOps Engineer with a deep passion for optimizing technology processes to drive productivity and innovation. Over the past five years, I have specialized in cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment automation, consistently seeking ways to streamline workflows and enhance system reliability. My approach centers on using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with tools like Ansible and Terraform to deliver scalable, resilient, and cost-effective solutions on platforms such as AWS and Alibaba Cloud.

I thrive on creating seamless integrations between development and operations teams, ensuring systems are automated and secure, allowing developers to focus on innovation. From containerized applications with Docker to orchestrated Kubernetes clusters, my goal is to build infrastructure that supports growth and adapts to evolving business needs.

At the heart of my work is a commitment to fostering collaboration and reliability in every project. By bridging development and operations, I aim to provide a robust foundation for high-performing applications and a scalable infrastructure that is ready for the future.
